## Data: 

```{r Tidyverse, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

```

![Penguins of Interest](C:\Users\Karianne Kapfer\Desktop\GitHub\penguins\Penguinphoto.png)  

This data comes from Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network.

The Data contains information about the species, island found, body measurements, etc.  

The Data itself:
```{r data, results="hide", warning=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
penguins_raw
```

Exploring the data:
```{r exploring, results='hide'}
#view(penguins_raw)
#View(penguins)
#colnames(penguins)
##?penguins
```


![Body Parts Of Interest According To The Data](C:\Users\Karianne Kapfer\Desktop\GitHub\penguins\body.webp) 

## Single Trait Distibution

```{r SingleTrait, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = species, y = body_mass_g, fill = species))


```

Here we see that Gentoo penguins generally have the largest body mass (this is in grams).  


## Relationship Between Multiple Traits

```{r MultipleTraits, warning=FALSE}
#Note to self: Two continuous colored by species 
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))

```

It is interesting that despite having the biggest body mass, the Gentoo penguins generally have the smallest bill depth and length. 

## Sexual Dimorphism 

```{r SexualDimorphism, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +  
  facet_wrap(~ species)
```
Here we see that in each species the males generally have large beaks across all species.   

```{r, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +  
  facet_wrap(~ year + species)

```

Here you can see that even across years for all species the males generally had bigger beaks
