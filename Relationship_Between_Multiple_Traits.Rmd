```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r MultipleTraits, warning=FALSE}
#Note to self: Two continuous colored by species 
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = species))

```

It is interesting that despite having the biggest body mass, the Gentoo penguins generally have the smallest bill depth and length.
