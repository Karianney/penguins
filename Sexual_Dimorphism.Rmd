```{r packages, include=FALSE}
library(palmerpenguins)
library(tidyverse)

```

```{r SexualDimorphism, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +  
  facet_wrap(~ species)
```
Here we see that in each species the males generally have large beaks across all species.   

```{r, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = penguins) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = bill_depth_mm, color = sex)) +  
  facet_wrap(~ year + species)

```

Here you can see that even across years for all species the males generally had bigger beaks
